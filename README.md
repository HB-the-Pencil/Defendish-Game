# Defendish-Game
This is a clone of the arcade game Defender created in Pygame. Sprites were redrawn by hand and based on the spritesheet found at [https://seanriddle.com/defendersprites.jpg](https://seanriddle.com/defendersprites.jpg). The project is based on Chapter 12 of the book Python Crash Course.
